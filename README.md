DESCRIPTION:E-commerce Product Analysis Notebook
This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce product dataset. The analysis includes data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and various visualizations to understand the dataset better.

Sections:
Load the Dataset:

Import Libraries: Imports essential libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Load Data: Reads the e-commerce product dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Analyzing the Data:

View Data: Displays the first and last five rows of the dataset.
Shape and Info: Checks the shape and basic information (data types, non-null counts) of the dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns and plots them for better understanding.
Data Cleaning:

Missing Values: Identifies missing values and calculates their percentages.
Duplicates: Detects and counts duplicate records in the dataset.
Outliers: Uses box plots to identify outliers in the 'Price' column.
Feature Engineering:

Date Conversion: Converts 'DateAdded' column to datetime format and extracts year, month, and day into new columns.
Categorical Encoding: Encodes categorical data ('Category') using LabelEncoder.
Column Types: Identifies categorical and numerical columns.
Univariate Analysis:

Distributions and Counts: Visualizes the distribution of numerical columns and the counts of categorical columns.
Correlation Matrix: Analyzes correlations between numerical features using a heatmap.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:

Feature Relationships: Uses scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to analyze relationships between different features.
Sales Analysis:

Sales Trends: Analyzes and visualizes sales trends over months and years.
Category and City Analysis: Visualizes sales by category and by the top 10 cities.
Top Categories: Identifies and plots the top 10 categories by average rating, number of reviews, and sales.

CONCLUSION:The E-commerce Product Analysis notebook provides a thorough examination of the dataset, revealing key insights such as sales trends over time, the impact of different categories and cities on sales, and the identification of top-performing categories in terms of average rating, reviews, and sales. The analysis highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of sales patterns, addressing data quality issues like missing values and duplicates, and leveraging feature engineering for more detailed insights. These findings can inform strategic business decisions, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction by focusing on high-performing product categories and regions.
